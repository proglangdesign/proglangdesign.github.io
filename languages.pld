  description
   Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/">Pegasus3D</a> browser, and the web is powered by languages.
   His <a href="https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone">Cone</a> language powers the 3D web.
   Cone is statically-typed, and uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables.
   Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory management.
   His previous work, <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html">Acorn</a>
   is a dynamic language with some of the same features.
