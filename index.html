      <dd>
        Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his
        <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/">Pegasus3D</a> browser,
        and the web is powered by languages.
        His <a href="https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone">Cone</a>
        language powers the 3D web.
        Cone is statically-typed, and
        uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables.
        Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory
        management.
        His previous work,
        <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html">Acorn</a>
        is a dynamic language with some of the same features.

        <a href="https://github.com/Dyvil/Dyvil">Dyvil</a> is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM. It is a compiled, statically and strongly typed language that supports object-oriented, functional and imperative programming styles. The language features many high-level constructs as well as an extensible and expressive syntax, making it highly useful for both rapid and safe prototyping, and the creation of domain-specific languages.

It is open because it easily integrates foreign tools and libraries, e.g., Python libraries or command line tools. It is general because it has the expressive power of a functional programming language while automatically parallelizing and distributing program execution. Cuneiform uses distributed Erlang to scalably run in cluster and cloud environments.

          is a compiled systems language focusing on providing extreme extensibility through the
          use of a compile-time API. Using such an API, compiler extensions can be created within
