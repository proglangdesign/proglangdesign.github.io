      <dd>Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/">Pegasus3D</a> browser, and the web is powered by languages.
His <a href="https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone">Cone</a> language powers the 3D web.
Cone is statically-typed, and uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables.
Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory management.
His previous work, <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html">Acorn</a>
is a dynamic language with some of the same features.</dd>

      <h2>IRC bots</h2>

      No channel is complete without a collection of noisy bots.  They
      are also a good way to show off your programming language.  The
      following bots can be found on #proglangdesign.  Please do not
      abuse them; it is not their fault.
