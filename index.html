        Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his
        <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/">Pegasus3D</a> browser,
        and the web is powered by languages.
        His <a href="https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone">Cone</a>
        language powers the 3D web.
        Cone is statically-typed, and
        uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables.
        Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory
        management.
        His previous work,
        <a href="http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html">Acorn</a>
        is a dynamic language with some of the same features.

        The <a href="https://github.com/rebuild-lang">Rebuild Language Project</a> aims to 
        research and hopefully build the ultimate system programming language.
        It's a collection of ideas and experiments to bring better concepts into programming languages.
        Watch an introduction talk on <a href="https://youtu.be/aKFjP8ozfjE">Youtube</a><br/>
        The project uses a modern C++17 based experimental compiler to conduct experiments.
        I develop these experiments during live streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/arbmind">Twitch</a>.
