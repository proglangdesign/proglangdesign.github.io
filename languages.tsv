Cone		https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone	Acorn2		Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his <a href='http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/'>Pegasus3D</a> browser, and the web is powered by languages. His <a href='https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone'>Cone</a> language powers the 3D web. Cone is statically-typed, and uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables. Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory management. His previous work, <a href='http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html'>Acorn</a> is a dynamic language with some of the same features.

NGS		https://github.com/ilyash/ngs	ilyash	https://github.com/ilyash	<a href='https://github.com/ilyash/ngs'>NGS</a> - Next Generation Shell, a language (and a shell in the future) for ops tasks. NGS aims to be an alternative for both bash/Python/Ruby/Perl/Go and configuration management tools. It has syntax for the common operations and libraries (currently only AWS) for idempotent resources manipulation. NGS unique features include built in exit code handling and syntax for run-a-command-and-parse-output.
Oopsilon		http://github.com/Oopsilon/Oopsilon	JX7P	http://github.com/Oopsilon	<a href='http://github.com/Oopsilon/Oopsilon'>Oopsilon</a> is an object-oriented language in the Kayian tradition which is (perhaps uniquely) founded on a negativist philosophy drawing on critical theory and stressing the importance of hermeneutics in understanding the problems programmers experience.
Psyche-c		https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec	ltcmelo	https://github.com/ltcmelo	<a href='https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec'>Psyche-c</a> is a compiler for incomplete C code. It features a Hindley/Milner-inspired type inference engine for C.
